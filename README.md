# Game Dev Career Pathways

### Game Programmer:
Game programmers develop software and engines for games and create prototypes for games.
  - AI Programmer
      - Focuses on the programming behind the movement and actions of Non-Player-Character behavior.
      - Machine Language Engineer: Focused on designing and implementing machine learning applications.
      - Prompt Engineer: Prompt engineers get generative AI applications to output a specific output.
      - AI Developer:  An AI developer incorporates AI functionality into software applications.
    
  - Graphics Programmer
      - Graphics Programmers specialize in writing software that generates the visual elements of a game
      - Front-end developer: Builds the front-end of websites and web applications, this is the part users see and interact with.
      - Rendering Engineer: They implement rendering technology on multiple platforms and are involved in architectural design.

  - UI Programmer
      - UI programmers work within the UI/UX team of a game studio to implement the designs provided to them into the game engine
      - UI Developer/Engineer: Builds designs for web, mobile, and desktop applications.
    
  - Tools Programmer
      - Tools Programmers develop and maintain the software tools that empower the development team to work efficiently.
      - Pipeline Tools Programmer: Focuses on creating and optimizing tools that streamline the development pipeline.
    
  - Gameplay Programmer
      - Gameplay programmers write the code for the interactions that make a game fun to play.
      - Gameplay Engineer: Similar to a gameplay programmer but may also involve broader engineering tasks.
    
  - Engine Programmer
      - Develops/works on the engine the game runs on

### Level Designer
  - Creates the world the game takes place in
  - Must create nice-looking environments while also considering Flow, Pace, and Skill so as to have a fun playing experience
  - Especially in games with a high focus on narrative, making the narrative tie into the environment is important (The Last of Us couldn't take place in Candy Land :/)

### Systems Designer
  - Assembles many technologies/programs that need to be used to create the game.
  - Identifies software and hardware that may be needed to create the game.
  - Leads prototypes and Idetiftys where in the game AI might be needed

### FX Artist
  - Creates the Visual Effects to enhance the visual appeal of the game
  - Uses real-world effects to get an idea of scale, shape, color and design when creating effects
  - There are Gameplay effects that enhance the overall action of the game, (Spell casting effects, muzzle flash, etc.) and Environmental Effects which enhance the surroundings (Rain, Snow, etc.)

### Gameplay Animator
  - Creates the animations for the game, including player animations, enemy animations, object animations, etc.
  - They can use, keyframes and set each bone individually or motion capture and physically act it out.
  - Maintain large libraries to reuse animations, saving lots of time.

### Game Artist
  - Often a General animator and/or 3D modeler that creates 2D and 3D art for game. Using concept art and design briefs they can bring a game to life.
  - They work on visual elements required to assemble a game. This includes characters, objects, textures, assets, environments, props, vehicles, weapons, etc.
  - Can give a game a unique design and personality.
